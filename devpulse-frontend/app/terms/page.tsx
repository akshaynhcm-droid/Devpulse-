            <p>
              By creating an account, signing in, or using DevPulse you agree to
              these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the service. If you
              use DevPulse on behalf of an organization, you represent that you
              have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

            <p>
              DevPulse provides API security scanning, LLM cost monitoring,
              shadow API detection, compliance reporting, a kill switch, and
              related dashboards. Features vary by plan. We improve the service
              over time; we may add, remove, or modify features, but we will
              give reasonable notice before removing or materially degrading a
              paid feature.
