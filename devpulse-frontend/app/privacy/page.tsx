            </h2>
            <p>
              Account data and customer content are stored in MySQL 8 hosted in
              the region you select at signup (EU or US). Data in transit uses
              TLS 1.3. Passwords are never stored in plaintext — only the PBKDF2
              hash plus a per-user 32-byte salt. Secrets and API keys are stored
              server-side only and never logged. Access to production data is
              limited to named personnel, gated by hardware-backed SSO, and
              every access is written to an append-only audit log.
